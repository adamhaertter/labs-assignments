CSC 310 - Strassen's Algorithm Programming Project  
Spring 2021

## General Information
This program is written in Java.
It features 5 classes, one for each algorithm, one for running the tests, and one for the common operations.
The code requires an "input.csv" file to be present in the root folder. One has been provided alongside the source code.
If an input.csv file is missing, one can be generated by uncommenting the line `// createMatrixFile(20, 10);` in main(). This will overwrite any file named "input.csv" that exists in root, so please only uncomment it if the original input.csv goes missing.
The file "Final Results.xlsx" is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing the results and data obtained throughout this project. The tables, graphs, and final results are all present inside that file.

## How to Run
The file "Runner.java" contains the main() method. The code should be run through this file and produce an output through the console. As mentioned above, some input.csv is necessary for the code to run, but I provided mine in the submission.
