# labs-resume
A compilation of various labs and projects from multiple classes throughout my school experience.

## What is this?
This repository acts as a backup and compilation of various labs, projects, and assignments that I've had to do in my classes.
Independent projects or projects of personal interest won't be included here.

In most cases, the projects here will be left as they are, even if that means that I've found bugs with them after submission or something similar.
For example, a program that encounters a segmentation fault on a bad input will still likely do that, but I want to keep them as they are to preserve them in some fashion.
